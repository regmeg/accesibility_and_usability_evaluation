      <h3>Accessibility and Usability Features</h3>
      <h4>"Skip to main content" link</h4>
      <p>This website offers a hidden "Skip to main content" link on the very top of the page, as seen in the image below. It is intended to be used by screen reader users in order to skip the navigation menu.</p>
      <img src="images/skip_to_content.png" alt="This image shows the location 'skip to main content' link at the very top of the page"/>
      <h4>Selection Focus</h4>
      <p>All navigational menu and link items have distinct focus graphics, so that tabbing users don't get lost, as seen in the images below</p>
      <img src="images/menu_focus.png" alt="This image shows the graphic of focused menu item, which is distinct from the selected and unselected one. "/>
      <img src="images/link_focus.png" style="border: solid 1px gray" alt="This image shows the graphic of focused link item, which is distinct from the unselected one. "/>
      <h4>Usage of aria-labels</h4>
      <p>Aria labels help the assistive technology such as screen readers to read extra information about the region of the page that users enters. Those have been used throughout different sections of the page as seen in the next image.</p>
      <img src="images/aria_label.png" alt="This image shows HTML code, where 'aria-labelledby' attribute has been used within a section in order to label it accordingly to the heading element used within that section."/>

      <h3>Site's Accessibility</h3>
      <p>Websites accessibility has been evaluated using <a href="https://web2access.org.uk/platforms/website/versions/2/tests">Web2Access Framework</a>, which is based on <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/">WCAG 2.0 Guidelines</a>. Due to site being purely informational and non functional, it is fairly easy to score 100% in all the tests. This site has been thoroughly tested with the WebAim extension to ensure accessible HTML. As well as NVDA was used to listen to the tabbing and keyboard responses on the website. The testing results can be seen in the table below.</p>
